# Chem-Man

A very nice algorithmic/programming [challenge](https://github.com/ChemAxon/chem-man/tree/master) by Péter Kovács, PhD; ChemAxon (no affiliation on my part).

No source code for this one, but it can be done with less than 500 lines of rust [I promise](https://github.com/ChemAxon/chem-man/blob/master/toplist.md) :)

```bash
$ cargo fmt ; cat *.rs | wc -l
498
```
